# C++ Solutions for USACO Problems

### DISCLAIMER: This code sucks. 

We're moving into the offseason for the USA Computing Olympiad, so I'm trying to learn how to use C++ for silver. I'm currently redoing a lot of bronze problems in CPP to relearn the basics. The code isn't very good or elegant - just working solutions that are 9/10 or 10/10 tc.
